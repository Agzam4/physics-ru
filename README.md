	This site contains course notes for algebra based physics. It combines <a href="https://explorabl.es/">explorable</a> <a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">explanations</a> with traditional methods of teaching physics. The explorables attempt to instill an intuitive understanding of physics and how it connects to our everyday experience. Also, they are just fun to play with.

	I wrote it for my students, but it might be useful if you are learning or teaching physics.
	I'm still adding content for 2019-2020. Let me know if you have any ideas or if you have found one of the numerous mistakes.
